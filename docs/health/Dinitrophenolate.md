# 2, 4 Dinitrophenolate (DNP)

**Introduction:** The most effective fat loss and the most dangerious supplement. The half-life is 2-4 days.

## How it works

Body uses Food energy, Electorones, Protones, and other substences to create ATP. DNP prevents protones joing the other substances to make ATP. So, DNP creates ATP deficit so the body needs ATP and all other materials like food and Electrones don't have Protones to make ATP and body has to do something with those. And typically the body burns them off as heat. As a result, body increase its metabolic rate (BMR) to tap body fat to oxidize as energy to address the ATP deficiency.

The more DNP take, the larger ATP deficit is creating which means the more heat the body is dissipating. It could result the internal organs to cooked from the inside out. It can kill you. This is not the substance for human consumption. Recommended low dosage and find the sweet spot!

It doesn't matter what types of foods you take, if your daily calories burning increased by DNP and excercise and other methods from 2800 to 4500, if you eat 3000 of mixture of carbs, fats, and protein, they will burn and then the body uses 1500 deficit calories from its own stores wether it is muscle, or body fats or whatever glycogen or something else. By just heating up that is not going to happen.

* Not following calories in and calories out
* Takeing all calories from carbs. Body will lose the muscles. Keep protein high.

## Dosage
