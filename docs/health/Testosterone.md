# Testosterone
It is from Testes and Steroids. It is associated to build muscles mass and strength.

## Muscles Anatomy
Muscles are built from muscle fibers. On each fiber we have Nuclei, Mitochondria, and active metabolisms.
They can respond to stress placed on them. Growing in size (Hypertrophy) from weight lifting or Shrinking (Atrophy)
if the muscle not being used heavily.
Within each muscle cell are strands of stiff proteins called Myofibrils that responsible to create tension.
On top of these there are some Satellite Cells they like muscle stem cells.
When you have high intense exercise those Myofibrils incur a little bit of damage. This produce inflammatory response 
to wake up healing and also Satellite cells and Satellite cells have Nuclei that responsible for making more of those
protein and also duplicate themselves to have more in control of contraction. 
Adding those protein causes muscle growth. 

When Testosterone come in the muscle cell it attaches to androgen receptor of muscles and go to the Nuclei and
activate certain genes to make more proteins of those Myofibrils and also other growth factors like 
Satellite cells. It also inhibits the protein break down. So, Testosterone can help my muscles grow after training.


Right after resistance training testes do secret more testosterone but only for about **30** minutes.
High volume and short rest periods usually induced the largest Testosterone release.


# MY CONCLUSION
* When using exogenous Testosterone because you cause more damage and also more conversion for 
making Myofibrils proteins you have to eat protein in your diet more than 2gr per kilo of your body weight
*
