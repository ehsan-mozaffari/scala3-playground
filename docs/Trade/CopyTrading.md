# Copy Trading:

You could copy the trading behaviour and strategies exactly like
the trader you chose.

**Copy trader**: The one who wants to copy from others trade.

**Copied Investor**: The one who shares his/her trades and strategies

#### Strategies:

1) **Automatic**: It copies like the trader you subscribed it.
2) **Semi-Automatic**: It copies like the trader you subscribed it, but you could choose.
   You then choose the positions you wish to replicate in your trading account.
3) **Manual**: It shows you the signal of the trader, and then you could do it by yourself.
   This is a little more like normal trading except traders now have access to the extensive knowledge and strategies of
   experienced traders.

#### Risks:

1) An anonymous person controls your portfolio
2) You could lose your money like the Copied Investors
3) Your commission might be different from the Copied Investors
4) Choosing a reliable trader to copy is not an easy task. A trader topping the leaderboards today may not have been
   there a few weeks back.
5) There are also signal provider risks. The signal provider may discontinue their service without notice, or get margin
   called by their broker, and this could inconvenience you if you have no plan B. The trader you have chosen to copy
   may also change their strategies to become more aggressive, and this could mean riskier trades.

#### Copy Trading comparison:

1) With Mirror Trading: Mirror trading mimic a trade strategy.
   Copy trading follows blindly the strategies and trades of the Copied Investor.
   However, in Mirror trading user can see the strategies and choose by his/her own choice.
2) With Social Trading: It is like Copy trading but in Social Trading networks
