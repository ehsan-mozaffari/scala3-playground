# PAMM
A percent allocation management module, commonly known as PAMM, also sometimes referred to as percent allocation 
money management, describes a software application used predominantly by foreign exchange (forex) brokers to 
allow their clients to attach money to a specific trader managing one or more accounts appointed on the basis of a 
limited power of attorney.

It is a trading platform that simultaneously monitors an unlimited number of 
managed accounts in Forex and operates in this way. So, in Forex you could use the 
PAMM platform as the way to connect PAMM manager with other investor traders with limited 
access for the PAMM managers but also PAMM accounts are closed in nature and 
often investors cannot study the trading strategies of the PAMM manager in details.

In other words, this software provides conditions for customers to be able to connect their account in forex to 
the account of one or more other traders in forex and copy their transactions directly to their account.

The important thing about the PAMM account is that the more profitable a Forex trader has an account, 
the more other traders are willing to connect their account to his account through the PAMM platform and in exchange for the profit he gets, give him a percentage of it.
